# DevShelf- Error_204

In the public folder we have stored all the html and css files. When files are to be downloaded then they are to be put in the same manner for it to work properly.

Rough structure should be something like this
'''project-root/
│
├── node_modules/
│
├── public/
│   ├── about.html
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── profile.html
│   ├── register.html
│   ├── search_profile.html
│   ├── search.html
│   └── stylef.css
│
├── index.js
│
├── users.json
├── UpdatedDatasetSOI.json
│
├── package.json
└── package-lock.json
'''
